# Movies Haven

**What is it, and why?**
- It is supposed to be an API that provides movies that are safe from any kind of political bias or agenda.
- Because from all of the app options in the internet (2023), none of them provided an API.

**Technologies**

- This project tries to use the minimum number of packages possible. Typescript, NestJS and other recent tech were an option before, but I believe this project should be able to run in the tiniest setup possible (e.g: raspberry pi zero), in every legacy hardware possible, also the simplest setup possible, so having a build process and dependencies on the most up-to-date environment and packages was discarded.
